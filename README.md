Hey there! I'm Advaita, software developer and the founder of [AKD Studios](https://github.com/akdasa-studios), a small company with a mission to help people learn and grow on a spiritual level. We're all about empowering folks to reach their full potential and be their best selves. We've got a knack for TypeScript and Python, and we make killer mobile apps too. I've got mad skills in front-end and back-end development, so my goal is to make software that not only solves problems, but also helps my clients grow and get better.
